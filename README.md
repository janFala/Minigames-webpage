# Second Javascript project - Collection of Minigames
## First Day
After watching, learning and practicing more javascript, html and css, I decided to create this project
- it's my second day of learning these languages

### Thoughts after first day
- My css skills are not the yellow from the egg (I get the basics, but suck at layout)
- I stole code for styling my buttons (but they have nice animations now)
- Javascript feels more familiar to use the more I learn (today I learned about objects (among other things), let's see if there will be classes)
- I also looked at localstorage and converting my objects to Json, I'm curious if you could't flood the localStorage of your webpage-visitors
- I still suck at naming variables (always have been)
- The js code is of better quality then yesterday, but the html and css is really not great
- I only finished the first game for now, tomorrow before learning, I will finish the second game. (after which I will probably do different projects)
